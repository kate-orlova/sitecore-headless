# Sitecore Headless
This project explores a new Sitecore Headless Development option allowing to start building Sitecore sites in ASP.NET Core with a built-in ASP.NET Rendering SDK for implementing a headless architecture where a remote rendering host runs the website using ASP.NET Core, similar to the existing Sitecore JSS headless developer option for front-end teams. Such architectural design supports rapid local development with a much lighter-weight front-end and allows changing things and debugging issues faster.
